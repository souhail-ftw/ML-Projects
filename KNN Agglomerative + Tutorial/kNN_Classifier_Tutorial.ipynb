Non-parametric means there is no assumption required for data distribution. So, kNN does not require any underlying assumption to be made. In both classification and regression tasks, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends upon whether kNN is used for classification or regression purposes.\n",

If k=1, then the data point is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbour.\n",

A large value of k makes it computationally expensive in terms of time to build the kNN model. Also, a large value of k will have a smoother decision boundary which means lower variance but higher bias.\n",

To optimize the results, we can use Cross Validation technique. Using the cross-validation technique, we can test the kNN algorithm with different values of k. The model which gives good accuracy can be considered to be an optimal choice. It depends on individual cases and at times best process is to run through each possible value of k and test our result."
